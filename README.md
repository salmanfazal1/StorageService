# StorageService
Scalable Storage Service with an External Configuration Service

Go to Directory:
1. run "ant" to initialize
2. run "java -jar ms3-ecs.jar" to run the external configuration Service.
3. run "java -jar ms3-client.jar" to run a client side shell

Disclaimer: The Service is not fully stable and some of the features require work currently.
